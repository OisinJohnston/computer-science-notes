There are two ways to declare variables in javascript using the var keyword and the let keyword. All variable names in javascript must begin with a letter or an underscore, you cannot name a variable that starts with a number. You also may not use a reserved word as a variable. A list of resereved words can be found here It is best practice to define variables in camelCase, by capitalising the second letter of each word The var keyword defines a variable in the current scope, but we needn't worry about that now. using var with no initial value var variableName; using var with an initial value var variableName = 10; The let keyword defines a variable in the global scope, again don't worry about that now. using let with no initial value let variableName; using let with an initial value let variableName = 10; Constants A constant is like a variable except for the fact it cannot be changed. constants are declared using the const keyword. It is best practice to define your constants in UPPER_SNAKE_CASE, using uppercase and seperating words with _ 's example: const CONSTANT_NAME = 10; Datatypes All datatypes can be set as the value for a variable or a constant There are 7 primitive data types in Javascript: string number bigint boolean undefined symbol null but for the purposes of berevity I will only talk about: string number boolean the type datatype can be found using the typeof keyword Strings strings are used to store text. they are created by putting the desired value into \" . or by calling the String() constructor. example: var myString = \"This is a string\" console.log(typeof myString) // string Numbers numbers are used to store well numbers, you needn't wrap them in anything just leave them as they are. they can also be made by calling the Number() constructor example: var myNumber = 10 console.log(typeof myNumber) // number Booleans booleans are used to store true/false data there are only two booleans true and false they are used in if statements and for loops. they can be made using the Boolean() constructor or by using a comparotor like == example: var myBoolean = true console.log(typeof myBoolean) // boolean myBoolean = 1==2 // false coneole.log(typeof myBoolean) // boolean","title":"Javascript Basics"},{"location":"javascript/basics/#javascript-basics","text":"","title":"Javascript Basics"},{"location":"javascript/basics/#contents","text":"Comments Variables Constants Datatypes","title":"Contents"},{"location":"javascript/basics/#comments","text":"NB: You will be marked on your comments in the leaving cert Comments are a way of describing your code without the machine executing it Comments can be divided into two types: Single-line: Single line comments can only span across one line and are denoted by a // example: // This is a single line comment Single line comments can also be written after code example: console.log(\"Hello, World!\"); // a single-line comment after some code Multi-line Multi line comments can span across multiple lines and start with a /* and end with a */ example: /* This is a multi-line comment */ They can also go after code console.log(\"Hello, World!\"); /* A multi-line comment after some code */","title":"Comments"},{"location":"javascript/basics/#variables","text":"A variable is a box in which data can be stored, they can be initialised with and without data.
