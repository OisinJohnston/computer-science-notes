# Databases

## Information systems

* An information system is a combination of software and hardware designed for creating, recording, storing, processing and communicating information

* Information systemds allow for data analysis which can extract knowledge from data and information, which is otherwise difficult to visualize

### Example of an information system

The systems in schools which store information about:

 * Teacher and stuedent timetables

 * Teachers' class groups
 
 * Students' academic record

 * Facility for teachers to enter data on Students' performance and behaviour

 * Bookings for labs, libraries and computer rooms

 * Behind the one front end there are multiple files some of which are databases.

In our school we use VSWare as one such information system.

## What is a database?

**A database is a collection of data stored in an organised or logical manner, which can be managed accessed and updated**

Advantages of a database:

* Easily store large amounts of data

* Multiple users can access the data at the same time

[//]: # (* Improved security - data can be encrypted and password protected)

* Can interact with multiple systems: mobile phones, business software and webpages


## SQL Database terminology

* **Table:** A collection of related data made up of rows and columns

* **Record/Instance:** One row in the table, holds data about some entity

* **Attributes/Fields:** The columns of your database and the data it stores.

Each attribute has a piece of data about an individual, each attribute/field has a description outlining the data type associated with it.

## Datatypes

Datatypes are the types of data stored in a column

Examples of datatypes:

 * CHAR(size) - for a fixed length string

 * VARCHAR(size) - for a variable length string

 * BOOL - stores a true or false value

 * NUMBER - for storing a numerical value - not a numerical string, use a CHAR or VARCHAR for that.

 * DATE - for storing dates


## Database - types

 * Flat file database

 * Relational databases (e.g PostgreSQL)

 * Non relational databases (e.g Firebase)

 * Graph databases (e.g. Neo4j)





### Flat File databases

A flat file database is just a single table each row in the table is called a record and each column is an attribute,
Think of a flat file database as a single page in an excel file.

Flat file databases can also be represented in CSV files.

A CSV (Comma Seperated Values) is a file that represents a table by seperating each column with a deliminator typically a comma and each row with a newline

CSV files are typically used for importing and exporting data from different types of databases.


### Relational databases

A type of database that stores and priovides access to data points that are related to one another
