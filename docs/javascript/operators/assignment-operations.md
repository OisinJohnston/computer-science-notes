it's used to assign a value to a variable

```

the `+=` operator adds a given value to a variable
```js
let x = 10;
x += 5; // 15
```

## The -= operator
The `-=` operator subtracts a given value from a variable
```js
let x = 10;
x -= 5; // 5
```

## The *= operator
The `*=` operator multiplies a given value to a variable
```js
let x = 10;
x *= 10; // 100
```

## The /= operator
The `/=` operator divides a given value to a variable
```js
let x = 10;
x /= 5; // 2
```

## The **= operator
The `**=` operator puts a given value to the power of a variable
```js
let x = 8;
x **= 2; // 64
```
